# Deep-Learning-Implementations
Simple deep learning models were created to model the parameters in real life cases

Basic Implementation and workflow of Tensorflow on Neural Nets is explained with an example here.
The values for the first single layered Neural network had predicted of around 230.5 and actual values was 231.8 Farenheit for 111.0 degree celsius.

As more and more number of layers were added the prediction score improved and the value obtained was 231.5.
